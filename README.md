Mod Public License, v2. WIP.
=========
This license is intended to fix some of the problems and loopholes in the original [MMPL](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft/blob/6.1.x/buildcraft_resources/LICENSE.txt), and in general make a modder-friendly, easily usable Open Source license for mods of all types.

Please keep in mind that this is currently very work-in-progress. Ideas, tweaks, working adjustments, and partial rewrites are happening as members of the modding community contribute ideas or express concerns.  
Once we've got a version that we're comfortable with, @jakimfett is going to have his lawyer read it and suggest changes for purposes of clarity and legality.

Thanks for your patience while we work through this process.

License Purpose
=========
This license intends to provide an easy to understand, relatively permissive license that addresses a number of fairly tricky constraints.
* Mod authors disappear, and the license doesn't allow anyone to build on their work
* People think a mod is cool, but can't determine if they're allowed to use it in modpacks
* Malicious and/or greedy individuals exploit mod popularity for profit, out of spite, or to spread malware
* Mod authors are hesitant to accept contributions due to potential complications with unclear contribution guidelines

This license is intended as a non-commercial, visible source, legally enforcable tool that encourages the author's creative process, allows the end user to have fun, and generally makes the modding community a better place.

This license is **not** intended to:
* Replace MIT, MMPL, BSD, or any other license.
* Start arguments about terminology or definitions.

All contributions, issue reports, and discussions via this Github project repo must be done in a civil, constructive manner. 

Seriously, be kind, considerate, and constructive, or GTFO.
